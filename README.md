# Envelopes

A budgeting application to allow you to use the envelope budgeting system without placing actual cash in actual envelopes. 

Since I began this project, a very similar application has since been implemented by [GoodBudget](https://goodbudget.com/envelope-budgeting/#.WE3xnqIrKO9), and so I will likely not continue to work on this, but it was excellent quick practice at getting an Angular application started, using Auth0 to implement authentication, and designing an intuitive interface for quickly entering data about monthly spending.
